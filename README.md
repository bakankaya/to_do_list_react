# To-Do List with React

This was a tutorial from Web Dev Simplified channel from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo).

My Current Goals to understand:

    - Why the checkbox not working
    - How to bind the hooks
    - The local storage thingy that he uses
    - **Bonus**: Find a way to publish via Github

To make the app unique and mine:

    - Add a new custom css
    - Add new icons, favicons
    - Maybe some new functionality
        - Like timestamps
        - Making the save function
        - To some extend, portability
